<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>There are <strong>two</strong> main ways to get started with Ghost, take care to use the method which best suits your needs.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong> - the downloadable zip files we provide on <a href="http://ghost.org/download">Ghost.org</a> are pre-built packages designed for getting started quickly. Cloning from the git repository requires you to install several dependencies and build the assets yourself. </p>

<h2>Versioning</h2>

<p>For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Ghost will be maintained according to the <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> guidelines as much as possible.</p>

<p>Releases will be numbered with the following format:</p>

<p><code>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;-&lt;build&gt;</code></p>

<p>Constructed with the following guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li>A new <em>major</em> release indicates a large change where backwards compatibility is broken.</li>
<li>A new <em>minor</em> release indicates a normal change that maintains backwards compatibility.</li>
<li>A new <em>patch</em> release indicates a bugfix or small change which does not affect compatibility.</li>
<li>A new <em>build</em> release indicates this is a pre-release of the version.</li>
</ul>
